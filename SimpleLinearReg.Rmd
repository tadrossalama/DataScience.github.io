In this lab, we will use simple linear regression to model the relationship between the variables `fandango_ratingvalue` and `imdb_norm`. Note that the IMDb ratings have been normalized between 0 and 5 so that they can be compared directly with Fandango ratings.

```{r}
summary(fandango$fandango_ratingvalue)
summary(fandango$imdb_norm)
```

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(fandango_ratingvalue ~ imdb_norm, data = fandango)
summary(lm1)
```
